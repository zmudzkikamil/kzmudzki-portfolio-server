 ## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Under Construction** ðŸš§

I chose NestJS for this small application because:

**Learning opportunity** I wanted to explore NestJS and its unique, modular structure.

**TypeScript-first approach** NestJS enforces TypeScript, aligning with modern development standards.

**Scalable design** Although this project is small, NestJS provides a strong foundation for scalability and maintainability, which is valuable for future projects.

This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with a framework often used in larger, commercial applications.



**UI/UX FIGMA Concept** Here are some of the initial UI/UX design concepts from
Figma. These mockups are part of the planning phase and serve as a starting
point for the visual development of the project.
